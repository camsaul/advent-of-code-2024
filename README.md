# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Prolog

Tested with [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

Example:

```bash
$ swipl
```

```prolog
?- consult('day-01.prolog'), run.
11
true.
```

For development I used Emacs with [Sweep](https://eshelyaron.com/sweep.html) which has nice REPL functionality.
